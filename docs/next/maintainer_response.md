# Response to Maintainer

You're absolutely right, I way overcomplicated this!

My actual use case: I'm building a security/telemetry shell that wraps system commands. After migrating from rustyline to reedline, I hit an annoying issue where after running vim, python, or other PTY commands, the prompt wouldn't appear until users pressed Enter. I got obsessed with fixing this "missing prompt" issue and went down a rabbit hole.

The real problem is simple: when my shell runs PTY commands, Reedline doesn't know to suspend its terminal handling, so the terminal state gets corrupted. The prompt is actually painted but not visible, and everything feels broken.

All I really need is programmatic access to set `suspended_state` (which currently only ExecuteHostCommand can do). 

I'm closing this PR and will open a much cleaner one that just adds:
```rust
pub fn suspend_guard(&mut self) -> SuspendGuard
```

About 25 lines total. The guard sets suspended_state and clears it on drop. No filters, no feature flags, no complexity.

Thanks for the pushback, it led to a much better solution!
