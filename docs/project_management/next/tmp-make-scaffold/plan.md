# tmp-make-scaffold — plan

## Scope
- Feature directory: `docs/project_management/next/tmp-make-scaffold`
- Orchestration branch: `feat/tmp-make-scaffold`

## Goal
- Produce shippable, test-backed behavior aligned to the specs in this directory.

## Guardrails (non-negotiable)
- Specs are the single source of truth.
- Planning Pack docs are edited only on the orchestration branch.
- Do not edit planning docs inside the worktree.

## Triads
- C0: init slice (code/test/integ)
