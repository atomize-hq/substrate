# linux_guest_rootfs_backend — Integration Map (Stub)

Status: stub (intentionally incomplete).

This document will track dependencies on:
- `docs/project_management/next/world_deps_selection_layer/` (WDL2 `world deps provision` contract)
- `docs/project_management/_archived/p0-agent-hub-isolation-hardening/` (full cage / Landlock prerequisites)
- `docs/project_management/next/world-sync/` (future image pinning via workspace init; out of scope for the initial ship)
