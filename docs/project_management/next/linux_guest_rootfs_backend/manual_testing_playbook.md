# linux_guest_rootfs_backend — Manual Testing Playbook (Stub)

Status: stub (intentionally incomplete).

This playbook will define manual validation for:
- Linux guest-rootfs warm flow
- `world_fs.isolation=full` executing inside the guest rootfs
- Linux `substrate world deps provision` installing apt packages into the guest rootfs without mutating host OS packages
