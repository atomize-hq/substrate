## END — 2025-12-28T02:20:53Z — planning — planning pack scaffolding
- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Created the Planning Pack scaffolding (plan, specs, tasks, prompts, integration map, manual playbook, smoke scripts).
  - Rewrote the feature decision register to the two-option decision template with explicit follow-up task IDs.
  - Updated `docs/project_management/next/sequencing.json` to point the sprint to the feature directory and spec slices.
  - Updated the ADR related-doc links and validation artifact references to point to the Planning Pack.

- Sequencing alignment:
  - `sequencing.json` reviewed: `YES`
  - Changes required: updated sprint directory and sequence ids for this feature
- Blockers:
  - `NONE`
- Next steps:
  - Quality gate reviewer: run `docs/project_management/standards/PLANNING_LINT_CHECKLIST.md` and create `docs/project_management/next/policy_and_config_mental_model_simplification/quality_gate_report.md` with `RECOMMENDATION: ACCEPT`.
  - Execution triads: start `PCM0-code` and `PCM0-test` after the quality gate is `ACCEPT`.
