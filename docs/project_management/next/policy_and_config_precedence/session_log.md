## END — 2026-01-02T00:43:55Z — planning — ADR-0005 planning pack
- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Created a dedicated Planning Pack for ADR-0005 under `docs/project_management/next/policy_and_config_precedence/` (plan/tasks/specs/decision register/integration map/playbook/smoke scripts/kickoff prompts).
  - Updated `docs/project_management/next/ADR-0005-workspace-config-precedence-over-env.md` to reference the new feature directory and added the missing executive-summary drift guard.
  - Updated `docs/project_management/next/sequencing.json` to add the `policy_and_config_precedence` sprint and PCP0 slice.
  - Fixed ADR executive summary hashes via `make adr-fix` where required for mechanical lint.

- Next steps:
  - `PCP0-code`: implement resolver change in `crates/shell/src/execution/config_model.rs`
  - `PCP0-test`: update `crates/shell/tests/config_show.rs` precedence assertions
  - `PCP0-integ`: merge, run `make integ-checks`, run smoke, and record CI run ids/URLs

## START — 2026-01-02T01:04:22Z — docs — scaffold execution gates (feature start + slice closeout)
- Feature: `docs/project_management/next/policy_and_config_precedence/`
- Branch: `feat/policy_and_config_precedence`
- Goal: Add the execution preflight start gate and the per-slice closeout gate scaffolds so triads start with runnable smoke coverage and end with no-drift evidence.

## END — 2026-01-02T01:08:06Z — docs — scaffold execution gates (feature start + slice closeout)
- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Enabled execution gates in `tasks.json` meta and added the `F0-exec-preflight` gate task.
  - Wired `PCP0-code` and `PCP0-test` to depend on `F0-exec-preflight`.
  - Added per-slice closeout gate scaffolding for PCP0 and linked it from `PCP0-integ` (references + end checklist).
  - Updated kickoff prompts to include the execution gate prerequisites.
  - Adjusted planning docs to satisfy mechanical lint bans.

  - `docs/project_management/next/policy_and_config_precedence/tasks.json`
  - `docs/project_management/next/policy_and_config_precedence/execution_preflight_report.md`

- Blockers:
