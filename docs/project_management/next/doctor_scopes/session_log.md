- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Expanded the `doctor_scopes` Planning Pack into a full triad-executable plan (DS0) with cross-platform integration structure.
  - Finalized and extended the decision register with explicit A/B decisions, including API endpoint shape, exit codes, and no-side-effects posture.
  - Updated ADR-0007 status and aligned its contract text to the decision register and exit code taxonomy.
  - Added unambiguous specs, tasks, kickoff prompts, integration map, manual testing playbook, and smoke scripts.
