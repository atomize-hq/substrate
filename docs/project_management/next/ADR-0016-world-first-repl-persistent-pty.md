### Changes (operator-facing)
- Make interactive `substrate` behave like a normal in-world shell by default (persistent world PTY session)
  - Existing: In the REPL, most commands run in the world overlay view, but stateful builtins (`cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`) run on the host and operate on host paths/env; this can yield surprising “exists in world but cd fails” behavior.
  - New: The default REPL command path executes inside a persistent world PTY-backed shell session, so `cd`/`pwd`/`export`/`unset` behave like a normal shell within the same in-world filesystem view the user sees.
  - Why: Align REPL ergonomics with the isolation model and user expectations: a “world REPL” should be internally consistent and not require users to know which tokens are host-only.

    - `docs/project_management/next/ADR-0016-world-first-repl-persistent-pty.md#architecture-shape`

- Add explicit host escape hatch for interactive sessions (`:host ...`)
  - Existing: Host-only semantics are implicit via builtins and routing, and are not obvious when the overlay view diverges from the host filesystem.
  - New: `:host <command>` runs on the host (current behavior), while unprefixed commands run in the persistent world PTY session.
  - Why: Preserve operator access to host tooling while making the default path world-first and predictable.
  - Links:
    - `docs/project_management/next/ADR-0016-world-first-repl-persistent-pty.md#cli`

- Ensure `-c/--command` is world-consistent when world is enabled
  - Existing: `-c/--command` uses the same “lightweight builtin” fast-path as the REPL, so `cd`/`pwd`/`export`/`unset` can be executed on the host even when the command is otherwise world-backed.
  - New: When world is enabled, `-c/--command` MUST interpret `cd`/`pwd`/`export`/`unset` in-world (shell semantics) and MUST NOT execute them as host-only builtins; `:host` is never recognized in `-c/--command`.
  - Why: Prevent “mixed-context” surprises and avoid accidental host-path evaluation when the operator expects world semantics.

## Problem / Context
- The current interactive REPL mixes execution contexts:
  - Many commands are executed “in world” (overlay view) via world-agent request/response paths.
  - A small set of “lightweight builtins” (`cd`, `pwd`, `export`, `unset`) are executed by the host process to mutate host cwd/env.
- This yields a user-visible inconsistency: a path can exist in the world overlay view (e.g., created during a prior in-world command), but a subsequent `cd <path>` fails because the host cannot resolve the path on the host filesystem.
- The workaround (`:pty bash`) works because it enters a real shell inside the world, but it is:
  - non-default,
  - not obvious to new users,
  - and does not persist Substrate’s own prompt/cwd/env semantics once the PTY exits.

## Goals
- Default interactive `substrate` REPL behaves like a normal shell *inside the world*:
  - `cd` changes the in-world working directory for subsequent commands.
  - `pwd` reports the in-world working directory.
  - `export`/`unset` affect subsequent in-world commands.
- Non-interactive `-c/--command` is consistent with world-first semantics when world is enabled:
  - `cd`/`pwd`/`export`/`unset` MUST NOT be implemented as host-only “lightweight builtins” when world is enabled.
  - Any state changes from `cd`/`export`/`unset` exist only within the invoked command’s shell/process (standard shell semantics).
- Preserve an explicit host escape hatch for interactive work: `:host <command>`.
- Retain high-signal diagnostics when the world backend is unavailable and `world_fs.require_world=true`.
- Maintain trace/event correctness:
  - Each REPL-entered command produces a trace command span with an accurate execution origin (`world` vs `host`) and exit status.

## Non-Goals
- Broad changes to non-interactive execution (`-c/--command`) beyond eliminating host-only “lightweight builtin” behavior when world is enabled.
- Implementing `world_fs.read_allowlist` enforcement in `world_fs.isolation=workspace` (reads remain unrestricted in workspace isolation).
- Replacing the “needs PTY?” heuristic for non-REPL executions (this ADR is REPL-focused).
- Providing Windows parity for interactive world PTY streaming (Windows work, if any, requires a separate platform-specific design).

## User Contract (Authoritative)

### CLI
- Interactive REPL (`substrate` with no `--command`/`-c`):
  - Default: Substrate starts and maintains a persistent in-world PTY-backed shell session (“world session”) when world execution is enabled and available.
  - All unprefixed input lines are executed inside the world session.
  - `exit` / `quit`: exits the REPL; Substrate shuts down the world session as part of cleanup.

- Non-interactive single-command mode (`substrate -c <CMD>` / `substrate --command <CMD>`):
  - When world is enabled and available, `<CMD>` MUST execute inside the world (non-PTY by default) and must observe the in-world filesystem view.
  - In this mode, `cd`/`pwd`/`export`/`unset` MUST NOT be executed as host-only builtins when world is enabled; they must be interpreted by the in-world shell/process.
  - When world is disabled, `<CMD>` executes on the host using host shell semantics.
  - `:host` MUST NOT be recognized in this mode.

- Host escape hatch:
  - `:host <command>` is the explicit host escape hatch in the Substrate REPL, but it MUST NOT be available by default.
  - Enablement rules (fail-closed):
    - `:host` MUST be recognized only in the interactive REPL (never in `--command` / `-c`, CI, or agent/automation flows).
    - `:host` MUST require explicit opt-in at REPL startup (e.g., a dedicated CLI flag and/or a REPL-only config/env knob). If not enabled, `:host ...` MUST NOT execute on the host.
  - `:host cd <path>` / `:host pwd` / `:host export ...` / `:host unset ...` are supported as host operations when `:host` is enabled.
  - Rationale: `:host` is a bypass of world isolation; it must be gated to prevent accidental or programmatic host execution.

- Exit codes:
  - Exit code taxonomy: `docs/project_management/standards/EXIT_CODE_TAXONOMY.md`
  - The interactive REPL process exit code remains `0` on normal `exit`/`quit`, and non-zero only on startup/config errors that prevent starting the REPL.
  - Per-command exit codes are surfaced via existing REPL printing behavior and recorded in trace spans.

### Config
- Existing world configuration continues to apply:
  - `world.enabled`, `world.anchor_mode`, `world.anchor_path`, `world.caged`
  - `world_fs.isolation`, `world_fs.mode`, `world_fs.require_world`
- A new setting MAY be introduced to control REPL-only behavior, but this ADR does not require it. If introduced, it must:
  - be REPL-only (not honored in non-interactive `--command`/`-c` and not available to CI/agent automation),
  - include an explicit knob to enable/disable `:host` (default disabled),
  - preserve a host-only mode for debugging/regression bisects (time-boxed).

### Platform guarantees
- Linux:
  - Interactive REPL uses the Linux world backend (world-agent over UDS) when enabled and available.
  - When `world_fs.require_world=true`, the REPL must fail closed on startup if the world backend is not available.
- macOS:
  - Interactive REPL uses Lima-backed world-agent streaming when enabled and available.
  - When `world_fs.require_world=true`, the REPL must fail closed on startup if the world backend is not available.
- Windows:
  - No changes required by this ADR; world PTY parity is explicitly out of scope.

## Architecture Shape
- `crates/shell` remains the REPL front-end:
  - Reads user input lines (Reedline).
  - Implements prefix routing for `:host`.
  - Maintains session lifecycle (start/stop) and trace spans per command.

- World session abstraction (new):
  - A long-lived PTY-backed shell process exists inside the world for the duration of the REPL session.
  - Substrate sends each input line to that shell and receives stdout/stderr stream data.
  - Substrate must derive an exit status per submitted command and update its in-world cwd tracking for prompt and downstream policy resolution.

- World backend requirements (Linux/macOS):
  - The world backend must support a long-lived interactive session (PTY stream) with:
    - a stable session identifier,
    - reliable stream framing,
    - and a deterministic “command boundary” protocol so the host can obtain an exit code per submitted line without terminating the session.

- Compatibility and safety invariants:
  - Host execution remains available only via explicit `:host` routing (no silent host builtins when world is enabled).
  - A command that mutates state (cwd/env) in the world session must have effects visible to subsequent unprefixed commands.

## Sequencing / Dependencies
- This ADR depends on the existing world-agent streaming (`/v1/stream`) and REPL routing layers but introduces a new “persistent session” requirement.
- No explicit triad dependencies are declared in this Draft; once scheduled, this work must be integrated into:
  - `docs/project_management/next/sequencing.json`
  - `docs/project_management/next/world-first-repl-persistent-pty/tasks.json`

## Security / Safety Posture
- Default behavior is world-first to avoid accidental host execution while the UI appears “world-like”.
- Fail-closed behavior when world is required:
  - If `world_fs.require_world=true` and the world backend is unavailable at REPL startup, Substrate must exit with a clear error (no host fallback).
- `:host` bypass controls:
  - `:host` MUST NOT be recognized in `-c/--command` or any non-interactive flow (CI/automation).
  - `:host` MUST require explicit opt-in at REPL startup and must fail closed when not enabled.
- Observability:
  - Every input line must produce a trace command span with:
    - execution origin (`world` vs `host`),
    - exit code,
    - and policy snapshot metadata when applicable.
  - Any new session-layer protocol must avoid logging secrets and must reuse existing redaction helpers.

## Validation Plan (Authoritative)
- Unit tests:
  - Add tests covering `:host` routing and ensuring no implicit host builtins are used when world is enabled.
  - Add tests covering the “world-only path exists” scenario:
    - Create a directory in the world overlay view.
    - Verify `cd <dir>` works in the REPL default mode and subsequent `pwd` reflects the new directory.
  - Add tests covering `-c/--command` consistency:
    - When world is enabled, `substrate -c "cd <dir>"` must not fail solely because `<dir>` exists only in the world overlay view.
    - Assert `:host` is not recognized in `-c/--command` (must fail closed / treat as a normal command string, not a bypass).
- Integration tests (Linux/macOS):
  - A REPL interaction harness must validate that a sequence of commands maintains in-world cwd state across multiple commands without requiring `:pty bash`.
- Manual playbook:
  - Add a manual playbook under the feature directory verifying:
    - `cd/pwd/export/unset` behave in-world by default.
    - `:host` can run host tooling without changing the in-world session state.

## Rollout / Backwards Compatibility
- Greenfield: legacy REPL behavior is removed.
- No compatibility switch, warnings, or transitional UX is permitted by this ADR.
- Any operator need for host execution must use the explicitly gated `:host` escape hatch described in this ADR.
