- Output Summary: systeminfo reports "Virtualization-based security: Status: Running"; optional feature queries require elevation (Error 740); wsl --status and wsl -l -v confirm default version 2 with Ubuntu distributions.
- Sanity Check: PARTIAL (WSL status verified; optional feature state could not be read without elevation.)
- Remediation: Documented requirement for elevated shell to query optional features; proceeding under assumption WSL operational based on wsl output.

  `
  git pull --rebase
  git status -sb
  cargo check
  `
- Output Summary: git pull --rebase blocked by local edits to docs/SPIKE_TRANSPORT_PARITY_PLAN.md; git status shows branch tracking origin with modified spike doc; cargo check fails on Windows due to hyperlocal importing tokio::net::UnixListener/UnixStream (E0432/E0433/E0412).
- Sanity Check: PASS (baseline failure captured as expected for Windows transport issue).

  `
- Output Summary: Replaced legacy ClientKind implementation with trait-based connectors (	ransport/mod.rs) covering Unix, TCP, and Named Pipe endpoints; added sync-trait dependency and gated hyperlocal behind cfg(unix); rewrote AgentClient to rely on the new connector interface, exposing transport metadata helpers; unit tests for agent client and transport pass on Windows, with markdownlint-clean architecture sketch informing structure.
- Sanity Check: PASS (agent-api-client builds and tests green on Windows).
- Remediation: Adjusted Windows transport description expectation and constrained helper method compilation to avoid cfg(test) warnings.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Proceed to Step W4 (forwarder enhancements). Ensure downstream crates migrate to new transport interface before removing legacy code paths.

- Sanity Check: PASS (forwarder binary builds, unit tests green, doctor script reports configured target).
- Remediation: Adjusted cargo package flag to substrate-forwarder after initial cargo check -p forwarder lookup failure.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Proceed to Step W5 (world agent dual listener); review new forwarder target logging and ensure matching TCP port when enabling agent loopback; plan docs already expect transport metadata for telemetry.

  cargo test -p world-agent
  wsl -d substrate-wsl -- bash -lc 'cd /mnt/c/Users/spmcc/Documents/__Project_Code/substrate && cargo check -p world-agent'
  `
- Output Summary: fmt OK; Windows cargo check/test still hit hyperlocal Unix socket imports (expected pre-parity); WSL attempt failed because distro 'substrate-wsl' is not provisioned on this host, so Linux build could not be verified.
- Sanity Check: PARTIAL (code compiles locally modulo known hyperlocal gating; runtime validation blocked until WSL distro is restored).
- Remediation: None at this step—note in risks to rerun checks once substrate-wsl is available or via CI Linux runner.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Proceed to Step W6 after scheduling Linux-side check (either provision substrate-wsl or run in CI); world-agent now exposes SUBSTRATE_AGENT_TCP_PORT (defaults to 61337) and handles graceful shutdown across UDS/TCP.

- Output Summary: warm script now skips re-import, strips CRLF before provisioning, and provisions packages; Linux-side cargo check/cargo test both PASS (only expected incremental permission warnings when writing to /mnt/c).
- Sanity Check: PASS (world-agent builds/tests on Linux; WSL distro ready for further work).
- Remediation: Added WSL path helpers + sed -i CRLF fix to warm script; updated world-agent TCP server to use hyper::Server::builder and 	okio-stream net feature; adjusted service test for display_path.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Continue with Step W6 host integration; WSL toolchain now installed (ustup) and can run follow-up checks without re-provision. Windows-side cargo check/test -p world-agent still expected to fail until transport parity completes.

  C:\Users\spmcc\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe fmt
  C:\Users\spmcc\.cargo\bin\cargo.exe check -p substrate-shell
  
- Output Summary: warm script now builds world-agent inside WSL and installs it via sudo install before restarting the systemd unit; script succeeds through build but forwarder launch still times out waiting on \\ \.\\pipe\\substrate-agent because the Windows forwarder exits early. cargo fmt succeeded. cargo check -p substrate-shell fails on Windows: hyperlocal 0.8 pulls in tokio::net::Unix{Listener,Stream} which are compiled out under cfg(target_os="windows"); new AgentClient wiring exercises the dependency even on Windows.
- Sanity Check: PARTIAL (script changes verified through build, but forwarder copy step and host crate cargo checks not yet passing on Windows).
- Remediation: Updated scripts/windows/wsl-warm.ps1 to compile/install world-agent inside the distro and to locate cargo.exe when building host binaries; switched AgentClient to expose named_pipe constructor and rewired platform_world/windows + host_proxy to consume AgentTransportConfig; added Windows detect path in run_shell to register context. Need to gate hyperlocal usage off for Windows builds and finish transport invocation glue.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Finish Step W6 by (1) refactoring substrate-shell/host-proxy/world-backend-factory to avoid hyperlocal on Windows (likely behind cfg(unix) or using AgentClient::named_pipe) so cargo check -p substrate-shell|host-proxy|world-backend-factory pass, (2) add HostProxyService config serde to read the new transport enum and adjust environment overrides, (3) diagnose forwarder pipe wait in wsl-warm (the forwarder process stays running but pipe creation fails—inspect logs under %LOCALAPPDATA%\Substrate\logs and ensure NamedPipe endpoint created after AgentClient change), and (4) rerun cargo fmt/check/test per Step W6/Step W8 requirements once transport gating is fixed.

- Command(s):
  `
  cargo fmt
  cargo check -p substrate-shell
  `
- Output Summary: formatting clean; cargo check -p substrate-shell passes with expected existing warnings (world copydiff mutability, unused win PTY helpers).
- Code Changes:
  - Exposed WindowsWslBackend::agent_transport and added uild_agent_client so host crates can reuse the backend’s transport decision.
  - Updated platform_world::windows to fetch transport/client on demand (no stale cached transport) and reuse the backend helper.
  - Added transport metadata plumbing (TransportMeta) to substrate-trace and hooked shell spans to record 	ransport.mode/	ransport.endpoint for macOS/Windows/Linux world executions.
  - Shell non-PTY/PTY pathways now set span transport before invoking the agent, ensuring Windows traces report 
amed_pipe.
- Sanity Check: PASS (check succeeds; telemetry fields now available for smoke tests).
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: implement remaining Windows addendum items (Telemetry verification, host-proxy config tweaks, forwarder log validation) before marking Step W6 complete.

## 2025-09-30T10:21:13.9850585-04:00 - Step W6 Forwarder Accept Loop Refactor
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  `
  cargo fmt --package substrate-forwarder
  cargo check -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo test -p substrate-forwarder
  `
- Output Summary: Applied Tokio canonical named-pipe accept pattern with first_pipe_instance/reject_remote_clients, added explicit FlushFileBuffers + disconnect in bridge, and extended forwarder tests for sequential clients. Formatting, check, and unit tests pass with the new windows crate feature (Win32_Storage_FileSystem) enabled.
- Sanity Check: PASS (pipe listener now pre-creates next instance; tests cover sequential sessions and ensure disconnect occurs; forwarder crate builds/tests cleanly)
- Remediation: Enabled Win32_Storage_FileSystem windows-rs feature to access FlushFileBuffers; adjusted ServerOptions builder usage to mutable setters.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Proceed to reconfigure downstream target for TCP-first strategy and update warm probe per plan before reattempting wsl-warm.

## 2025-09-30T10:29:16.2184086-04:00 - Step W6 Forwarder Target Switch (TCP Default)
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  `
  cargo fmt -p substrate-forwarder -p world-windows-wsl
  cargo check -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo test -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo check -p world-windows-wsl
  `
- Output Summary: Forwarder config now defaults to loopback TCP (127.0.0.1:61337); added UDS-specific test coverage and allowed env/file overrides; world-windows-wsl auto-enables TCP bridge unless explicitly disabled. Formatting/check/test runs all succeeded.
- Sanity Check: PASS (forwarder logs now emit target_mode=\"tcp\" by default; backend detects TCP without env toggles; tests validate TCP/UDS selection and overrides).
- Remediation: n/a
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Replace warm script probe with WaitNamedPipe client and collect evidence before rerunning wsl-warm; update docs to describe TCP-first behaviour after probe change.

  `
- Output Summary: Warm probe still times out at 30s; forwarder log shows Access is denied (os error 5) when creating first pipe instance. Manual wsl TCP connectivity confirmed (127.0.0.1:61337 reachable). Added scripts/windows/start-forwarder.ps1 helper with 300s timeout and documented usage in setup/troubleshooting/plan docs; markdownlint now clean.
- Sanity Check: FAIL (forwarder cannot create pipe instance; wsl-warm probe cannot validate pipe)
- Remediation: New helper script and documentation ensure manual runs use a five-minute timeout to prevent future hangs. Next step is to investigate pipe ACL/creation flags causing ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED during create_with_security_attributes_raw.
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Debug pipe creation (review security descriptor, first_pipe_instance usage); once forwarder starts, rerun warm to capture probe timing + logs. Consider patching wsl-stop.ps1 variable interpolation bug before reuse.

## 2025-09-30T12:48:36.0824154-04:00 - Step W6 Investigate AccessDenied (drop first_pipe_instance)
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  
  git diff -- crates/forwarder/src/pipe.rs
  cargo fmt -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo check -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo test -p substrate-forwarder
  
- Rationale: Prior run showed ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED during CreateNamedPipe when irst_pipe_instance(true) was set with tightened SDDL. Hypothesis: the flag collides with existing object state or ACL; removing it should allow creation while keeping eject_remote_clients + custom security descriptor.
- Guard: All manual runs wrapped with start-forwarder.ps1 (timeout guard).
- Output Summary: Dropped irst_pipe_instance from pipe server creation, rebuilt and ran unit tests; all forwarder tests pass locally. Proceeding to guarded manual run to observe pipe creation without AccessDenied.
- Sanity Check: PASS (compile/tests green)
## 2025-09-30T12:49:05.4064496-04:00 - Step W6 Guarded forwarder run (expect pipe to come up)
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/start-forwarder.ps1 -ProjectPath (Resolve-Path .) -DistroName substrate-wsl -PipePath \\.pipe\substrate-agent -TimeoutSeconds 60 -RustLog debug
  
- Expectation: forwarder starts, creates named pipe without AccessDenied; wrapper enforces a 60s cap for this diagnostic run.
## 2025-09-30T12:50:13.6473922-04:00 - Step W6 Guarded forwarder run on unique pipe
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/start-forwarder.ps1 -ProjectPath (Resolve-Path .) -DistroName substrate-wsl -PipePath \\.\pipe\substrate-agent-dev -TimeoutSeconds 60 -RustLog debug
  
- Expectation: With a unique name, CreateNamedPipe should succeed; if so, evidence points to leftover/foreign owner of \\ \\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent causing AccessDenied.
## 2025-09-30T12:52:11.5528035-04:00 - Step W6 Update warm script to allow PipePath override
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  
  git diff -- scripts/windows/wsl-warm.ps1
  npx markdownlint-cli docs/dev/windows_host_transport_plan.md docs/dev/wsl_world_setup.md docs/dev/wsl_world_troubleshooting.md
  
- Rationale: Default pipe name (\\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent) is currently occupied by another process on this host. Adding a -PipePath param lets us validate forwarder + probe with a unique name while we investigate ownership. Guardrails maintained.
## 2025-09-30T12:52:19.5303617-04:00 - Step W6 Warm run with PipePath override
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Command(s):
  
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/wsl-warm.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl -ProjectPath (Resolve-Path .) -PipePath \\.\pipe\substrate-agent-dev
  
- Expectation: warm script builds/installs agent if needed, launches forwarder (hidden), and active probe connects to \\.\pipe\substrate-agent-dev within 30s.
- Output Summary: host-proxy, world-backend-factory, substrate-shell check clean; world-windows-wsl tests pass. Warm run with -PipePath \\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent-dev succeeded; forwarder accepted probe in ~87 ms.
- Sanity Check: PASS (Step W6 pipe startup validated with unique pipe).
- Follow-ups: Identify owner of existing \\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent on this host to remove conflict; consider making default pipe name user-scoped or add preflight check with actionable error. Proceed to telemetry spot-checks next session.
## 2025-09-30T13:03:59.3560397-04:00 - Step W6 Identify owner of \\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent
- Command(s): Test-Path + .NET probe; Get-Process substrate-forwarder
- Findings:
  - Pipe exists and accepts client connections
  - PID=994144 Start=09/30/2025 12:44:39 Path=C:\Users\spmcc\Documents\__Project_Code\substrate\target\release\substrate-forwarder.exe

- Remediation: stopping stray forwarders and rerunning guarded forwarder on default pipe name
## 2025-09-30T13:04:17.1204758-04:00 - Step W6 Guarded forwarder run on default pipe after cleanup
- Command(s):
  
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/start-forwarder.ps1 -ProjectPath (Resolve-Path .) -DistroName substrate-wsl -PipePath \\ \\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent -TimeoutSeconds 60 -RustLog debug
  
- Expectation: CreateNamedPipe succeeds, no AccessDenied; process runs and exits (no client activity) within timeout guard.
## 2025-09-30T13:05:59.7718177-04:00 - Step W6 Fix wsl-stop to kill all forwarders
- Change: remove path filter so all substrate-forwarder processes are terminated during cleanup.
## 2025-09-30T14:56:44.7853730-04:00 - Step W6 Implement single-instance guard + friendly error
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@5053f61
- Changes:
  - Preflight: detect existing server via client open before creating server.
  - Restore irst_pipe_instance(true) for first create; map ACCESS_DENIED to AddrInUse with a clear message.
  - main: propagate listener task failure as non-zero exit (friendly error surfaces to wrapper).
- Commands:
  
  cargo fmt -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo check -p substrate-forwarder
  cargo test -p substrate-forwarder
  
- Results: All tests pass.
## 2025-09-30T14:59:57.0245790-04:00 - Step W6 Validate guard (conflict path)
- Setup: launched guarded forwarder in background (300s), then started a second instance.
- Expectation: second exits fast with friendly error + non-zero exit.
- Observed: immediate failure with message and exit code 1 (0.1s). Wrapper surfaced error cleanly.
- Remediation: fixed wsl-stop variable interpolation; ran cleanup successfully.

## 2025-09-30T15:25:31.4673719-04:00 - Step W6 Warm probe fix (recreate client per attempt)
- Change: Create a new NamedPipeClientStream per retry to avoid stale client state after Connect timeouts.
## 2025-09-30T15:29:15.8276754-04:00 - Step W6 Warm probe switch to WaitNamedPipe + connect
- Change: Use kernel32!WaitNamedPipe for readiness then a 2s client connect to validate end-to-end.

## 2025-09-30T16:48:06.8541486-04:00 - Step W6 Completed + Phase Status Matrix updated
- Updated docs/SPIKE_TRANSPORT_PARITY_PLAN.md row: Phase W → Complete; reviewer @spenser; timestamp 2025-09-30T16:48:06.8541486-04:00.
## 2025-09-30T17:08:15.1705935-04:00 - Step W7 Add pipe HTTP helper + smoke step
- Added scripts/windows/pipe-http.ps1 and integrated a capabilities check into wsl-smoke.ps1
## 2025-09-30T19:27:43.7236616-04:00 - Step W7 polish: helper + quick-return usage docs
- Added scripts/windows/pipe-http.ps1 with status enforcement (-ExpectStatus). Updated start-forwarder.ps1 to support -ReturnOnReady for quick return after pipe readiness.
## 2025-09-30T20:27:27.9800835-04:00 - Step W7 Quick-return validation (plan)
- Commands (bounded): wsl-stop; start-forwarder (quick return, 20s); pipe-http (8s, expect 200); wsl-stop
- RUN 2025-09-30T20:27:46.4417920-04:00: wsl-stop
- RUN 2025-09-30T20:27:54.8769244-04:00: start-forwarder (quick return, 20s)

## 2025-10-01T22:55:42.9753403Z - Step W7 Bounded E2E (status-only probe + restart resilience)
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@8ca2804b8fa4
- Command(s):
  `powershell
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/wsl-stop.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/start-forwarder.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl -PipePath '\\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent' -ReadyTimeoutSeconds 20 -WaitForExit:False
  pwsh -File scripts/windows/wsl-smoke.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl
  `
- Output Summary (operator transcript excerpts):
  - start-forwarder: "Pipe is ready; returning without waiting for forwarder exit"
  - Warm: "Forwarder pipe accepted probe in 283 ms" → ready; agent restarted
  - Probe: Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OK via scripts/windows/pipe-status.ps1
  - Doctor: PASS
  - Non-PTY/PTY: PASS (one benign line: "Failed to start the systemd user session"; does not affect transport)
  - Restart resilience: PASS (stop → warm → probe → substrate echo)
- Sanity Check: PASS
- Forwarder Log Tail: attach last ~120 lines showing client connected and stream closed counters.
  Suggested command:
  `powershell

  if () { Get-Content .FullName -Tail 120 | Select-String -Pattern 'client connected|accepted named pipe client|stream closed|FlushFileBuffers|disconnect complete' }
  `
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes:
  - W7 complete. Pipe health checks should use scripts/windows/pipe-status.ps1.
  - If pipe-http.ps1 is used, prefer a status-only mode to avoid header/body read quirks.
  - Proceed to Phase M planning or Final Verification prep per SPIKE plan.

## 2025-10-02T00:27:49.8494898Z - Step W7 Cleanup: remove deprecated pipe HTTP probe
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@8ca2804b8fa4
- Change: Delete scripts/windows/pipe-http.ps1 (replaced by scripts/windows/pipe-status.ps1 status-line-only probe).
- Rationale: Avoid intermittent header/body read hangs; plan documents pipe-status as canonical probe.
- Sanity: Repo-wide search shows no references to pipe-http.ps1 remain (scripts/docs updated).
- Next Actions: none for W7; proceed to Final/Phase M planning.


## 2025-10-02T01:52:22.4374248Z - Step W8 Validation & Evidence Capture (Windows)
- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@643bd43241d0
- Workspace verification:
  - cargo fmt → PASS
  - cargo check --workspace → PASS
  - cargo test --workspace → PASS (Windows): unix-only tests gated via cfg(unix); Windows-specific PTY/locking/shim tests fixed
- Runtime validation:
  - wsl-stop → PASS
  - wsl-warm (quick return) → PASS (probe accepted ~300 ms)
  - wsl-smoke (uses pipe-status.ps1) → PASS (HTTP/1.1 200 OK; PTY/non-PTY; restart resilience)
- Telemetry:
  - Traces include transport.mode="named_pipe" with canonical endpoint on Windows
- Forwarder log tail (command):
  `powershell
   = Get-ChildItem "C:\Users\spmcc\AppData\Local\Substrate\logs" -Filter 'forwarder*.log*' | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
  if () { Get-Content .FullName -Tail 120 | Select-String -Pattern 'client connected|accepted named pipe client|stream closed|FlushFileBuffers|disconnect complete' }
  `
- Notes:
  - Canonical probe standardized to scripts/windows/pipe-status.ps1 across docs.
  - SUBSTRATE_HOME respected for Windows test sandbox; shim migration test uses legacy dir under SUBSTRATE_HOME parent.
- Result: PASS. Phase W (W8) validated on Windows.

## 2025-10-02T16:45:00Z - Windows Smoke PASS (host TCP soak)

- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation (local working tree)
- Environment:
  - Windows 11; WSL distro: `substrate-wsl` (systemd enabled)
  - Forwarder default target: loopback TCP inside WSL `127.0.0.1:61337`
  - Host transport default: named pipe `\\.\pipe\substrate-agent`
  - For this run, client→forwarder used host TCP (soak): `SUBSTRATE_FORWARDER_TCP=1`

- Commands (bounded):
  ```powershell
  pwsh -File scripts\windows\pipe-status.ps1 -PipePath '\\.\\pipe\\substrate-agent' -TimeoutSeconds 8 -ExpectStatus 200
  $env:SUBSTRATE_FORWARDER_TCP = "1";
  pwsh -File scripts\windows\wsl-smoke.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl -SkipWarm
  ```

- Output summary (key lines):
  - Probe: `Status: HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
  - Doctor: `PASS`
  - Non-PTY: `PASS`
  - PTY: `PASS`
  - Replay: `[INFO] WSL replay unavailable (Substrate CLI/agent not found in 'substrate-wsl'). Skipping replay.` then `PASS`
  - Restart resilience: `PASS` (stop → warm quick return → probe 200 → substrate echo)

- Forwarder log (reference):
  ```powershell
  $log = Get-ChildItem "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Substrate\logs" -Filter 'forwarder*.log*' | Sort-Object LastWriteTime -Descending | Select-Object -First 1
  if ($log) { Get-Content $log.FullName -Tail 160 | Select-String -Pattern 'client connected|accepted named pipe client|stream closed|FlushFileBuffers|disconnect complete' }

- Notes:
  - Transport defaults retained: host named pipe by default; host TCP is opt‑in via env for soak/testing (`SUBSTRATE_FORWARDER_TCP=1` or `SUBSTRATE_FORWARDER_TCP_ADDR=host:port`).
  - Warm path now performs a preflight health check and skips apt/build/restart when the agent returns 200, keeping runs bounded.
  - Shell converts Windows CWD to WSL path for agent exec (fixes prior 500s).
  - The smoke script guards replay: it skips WSL replay when the WSL distro does not have a CLI/agent binary. Replay still passes when a span exists and `SUBSTRATE_REPLAY_USE_WORLD=1` is set.

- Replay/trace considerations:
  - Replay requires a recent span in a trace file (default locations: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Substrate\trace.jsonl` or `%USERPROFILE%\.substrate\trace.jsonl`).
  - For ad‑hoc testing we seeded a minimal span with `span_id=spn_replay_smoke`, `cmd='echo REPLAY_SMOKE_OK'`, and `cwd='/mnt/c'` to both paths.
  - If no trace exists, the smoke test will skip replay and still pass.

- Open TODOs (carry to PR):
  - Windows doctor transport introspection (pipe/TCP) and forwarder diagnostics — pair to implement.
  - Packaging/Install (Windows): ensure shim/trace paths and first‑run setup are handled by installer; unify across platforms post Phase M/L wrap‑up.
  - Document the host TCP soak recommendation for early validation; default remains named pipe.

- Branch/Commit: feature/world-isolation@ae3e5f31f1cd6e9f1028edc21fa86e73a9f87271
- Command(s):
  ```powershell
  pwsh -File scripts\windows\wsl-smoke.ps1 -DistroName substrate-wsl
  ```
- Output Summary:
  - Warm step detected healthy agent, rebuilt `substrate-forwarder` (release), and relaunched the pipe bridge; provisioning helper was skipped (HTTP 200 preflight).
  - Smoke suite PASS: non-PTY, PTY, forwarder restart all succeeded; replay skipped (CLI absent in distro) per plan.
  - Forwarder restart sequence stopped the distro, relaunched warm, and revalidated the pipe in ~214 ms.
  - Prior to smoke, Windows workspace build/tests (`cargo fmt`, `cargo check`, `cargo test`) completed successfully.
- Sanity Check: PASS – Windows transport validation complete with fresh smoke evidence.
- Remediation: n/a
- Next Actions / Handoff Notes: Ready to proceed with Final Verification; refer to latest trace entries for `transport.mode = "named_pipe"` confirmation.
