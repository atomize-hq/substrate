- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Completed Planning Pack docs: plan, spec manifest, impact map, contract, decision register, OR0/OR1 slice specs, telemetry and schema specs, and platform parity spec.
  - Added execution artifacts: tasks.json (schema v4), kickoff prompts for every task, CI checkpoint plan, manual testing playbook, smoke scripts, execution preflight report, and per-slice closeout reports.
  - Aligned sequencing spine and ADR: added sprint entry to sequencing.json; updated ADR-0017 to link to Planning Pack artifacts; fixed ADR executive summary hash.

## END — 2026-04-05T09:19:32Z — execution — F0-exec-preflight
- Recommendation:
  - `REVISE`
- Summary of findings:
  - `tasks.json` meta and checkpoint wiring are correct for schema v4 boundary-only execution (`checkpoint_boundaries=["OR1"]`, `CP1-ci-checkpoint` depends on `OR1-integ-core`, OR1-only platform-fix tasks present, OR0 has no boundary-only platform-fix tasks).
  - All 13 task ids have kickoff prompts, and every kickoff prompt contains the exact rule line `Do not edit planning docs inside the worktree.`
  - Blocking issue: `docs/project_management/adrs/draft/ADR-0017-agent-hub-concurrent-execution-and-output-routing.md` still declares `Status: Draft`, so the gate cannot verify an accepted ADR.
  - Blocking issue: smoke scripts do not mirror the manual execution path; they only wrap `cargo test` suites and do not drive real `substrate` workflows or assert canonical trace / operator-visible warning behavior from the playbook.

  - `python3` parse of fenced JSON in `ci_checkpoint_plan.md` → exit `0`
  - `python3` kickoff prompt coverage/rule verification across all task ids → exit `0`

## END — 2026-04-05T11:53:26Z — remediation — smoke/manual parity
- Summary of changes (exhaustive):
  - Replaced Linux/macOS smoke wrappers with temp-home/temp-workspace `substrate` smoke flows that run `workspace init`, drive `:demo-agent` plus `:pty` through a real REPL PTY session, assert transcript ordering, and assert canonical trace records with `jq -e`.
  - Replaced the Windows smoke wrapper with a temp-home/temp-workspace `substrate --no-world --command ":demo-agent"` flow that asserts canonical `agent_event` trace persistence.
  - Corrected the manual playbook prerequisites to include the Unix `script` dependency used by smoke automation and corrected the REPL exit directive from `:quit` to `exit`.
  - Refreshed ADR executive-summary hashes required by `planning-lint` for the ADRs referenced by this pack.
