# Opt-in World Netfilter Enforcement (Config Gate + Snapshot V3 Plumbing) - seam extraction

Source: user scope writeup (2026-03-25)

This pack captures seam briefs, authoritative threading, pack-level review surfaces, seam-exit intent, and governance scaffolds. It is intentionally one level above seam-local decomposition.

- Start here: `scope_brief.md`
- Seam overview: `seam_map.md`
- Threading: `threading.md`
- Pack review surfaces: `review_surfaces.md`
- Governance: `governance/remediation-log.md`

Execution horizon:

- Active seam: `SEAM-4`
- Next seam: `SEAM-5`

Policy:

- only the active seam is eligible for authoritative downstream sub-slices by default
- the next seam may later receive seam-local review + slices, and only provisional candidate-subslice hints
- active and next seams must eventually terminate in a dedicated final `seam-exit-gate` slice once seam-local planning begins
- future seams remain seam briefs
