# Kickoff Prompts (P0 Platform Stability)

Each task in `tasks.json` references a prompt in this directory. Prompts must include:
- Start checklist (feat/p0-platform-stability) with branch/worktree names.
- Spec mirroring between paired code/test tasks; integration prompts focus on merging/validation only.
- Scope/guardrails clarifying allowed work (code vs test vs integration).
- Required commands/tests/scripts.
- End checklist describing fmt/lint/test verification, merges, docs/log updates, and downstream prompt creation.


Do not edit planning docs inside the worktree.
