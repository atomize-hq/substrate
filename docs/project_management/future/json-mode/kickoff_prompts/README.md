# Kickoff Prompts (JSON Mode)

Prompts live here with filenames referenced in `tasks.json` (e.g., `J1-code.md`).
Each prompt must include:
- Start checklist (feat/json-mode) with branch/worktree names.
- Scope mirroring between code/test tasks; integration prompts focus on merging.
- Required commands/tests and guardrails.
- End checklist outlining merges, docs/log updates, and prompt creation duties.
