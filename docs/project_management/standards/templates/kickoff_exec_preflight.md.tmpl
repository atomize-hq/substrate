# Kickoff: {{TASK_ID}} (execution preflight gate)

## Scope
- Run the feature-level start gate before any triad work begins.
- This task is **docs-only** and must be performed on the orchestration branch (no worktrees).
- Standard: `docs/project_management/standards/EXECUTION_PREFLIGHT_GATE_STANDARD.md`
- Report: `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/execution_preflight_report.md`

## Start Checklist

Do not edit planning docs inside the worktree.

1. `git checkout feat/{{FEATURE}} && git pull --ff-only`
2. Read: ADR + Executive Summary, `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/plan.md`, `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/tasks.json`, `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/session_log.md`, relevant specs, and this prompt.
3. Set `{{TASK_ID}}` status to `in_progress` in `tasks.json`; add START entry to `session_log.md`; commit docs (`docs: start {{TASK_ID}}`).

## Requirements

Fill `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/execution_preflight_report.md` with a concrete recommendation:
- **ACCEPT**: triads may begin.
- **REVISE**: do not start triads until the listed issues are fixed and the preflight is re-run.

At minimum, verify:
- The cross-platform plan is explicit and matches the spec/contract (platforms + WSL mode if needed).
- Smoke scripts are not “toy” checks; they mimic the manual testing playbook by running real commands/workflows and validating exit codes + key output.
- Any CI dispatch commands embedded in integration tasks are runnable with the expected runners.

## End Checklist

1. Set `{{TASK_ID}}` status to `completed` in `tasks.json`; add END entry to `session_log.md` (include the recommendation and any required fixes).
2. Commit docs (`docs: finish {{TASK_ID}}`).
