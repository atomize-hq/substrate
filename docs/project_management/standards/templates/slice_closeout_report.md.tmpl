## Spec Parity (No Drift)

- [ ] Acceptance criteria satisfied
- [ ] Any spec changes during the slice are recorded (with rationale)

## Checks Run (Evidence)

- `cargo fmt`: pass/fail
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`: pass/fail
- Relevant tests: pass/fail (list suites/commands)
- `make integ-checks`: pass/fail

## Cross-Platform Smoke (if applicable)

Record run ids/URLs for required platforms:
- Linux:
- macOS:
- Windows:
- WSL:

If any platform-fix work was required:
- What failed:
- What was changed:
- Why the change is safe (guards, cfg, feature flags, etc.):

## Smoke ↔ Manual Parity

- [ ] Smoke scripts run the same commands/workflows as the manual testing playbook (minimal viable subset)
- [ ] Smoke scripts validate exit codes and key output (not just “command ran”)
