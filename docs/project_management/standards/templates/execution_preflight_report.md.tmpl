# Execution Preflight Gate Report — {{FEATURE}}

Date (UTC): {{NOW_UTC}}

Standard:
- `docs/project_management/standards/EXECUTION_PREFLIGHT_GATE_STANDARD.md`

Feature directory:
- `{{FEATURE_DIR}}`

## Recommendation

RECOMMENDATION: **ACCEPT** | **REVISE**

## Inputs Reviewed

- [ ] ADR accepted and still matches intent
- [ ] Planning Pack complete (`plan.md`, `tasks.json`, `session_log.md`, specs, kickoff prompts)
- [ ] Triad sizing is appropriate (each slice is one behavior delta; no “grab bag” slices)
- [ ] Cross-platform plan is explicit (`tasks.json` meta: platforms + WSL mode if needed)
- [ ] `manual_testing_playbook.md` exists when required and is runnable
- [ ] Smoke scripts exist where required and map to the manual playbook

## Cross-Platform Coverage (if applicable)

- Declared platforms: (from `tasks.json` meta)
- WSL required: yes/no
- WSL task mode: bundled/separate (if required)

## Smoke ↔ Manual Parity Check

Smoke scripts should mimic the manual playbook by running the same commands/workflows and validating exit codes + key output.

- Linux smoke: `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/smoke/linux-smoke.sh`
- macOS smoke: `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/smoke/macos-smoke.sh`
- Windows smoke: `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/smoke/windows-smoke.ps1`

Notes:
- (Record any gaps between smoke and manual coverage, and what must change before starting C0.)

## CI Dispatch Readiness (if applicable)

- [ ] Dispatch commands in integration tasks are correct and runnable
- [ ] Required self-hosted runners exist and are labeled correctly

Run ids/URLs (if executed during preflight):
- Linux:
- macOS:
- Windows:
- WSL:

## Required Fixes Before Starting C0 (if any)
