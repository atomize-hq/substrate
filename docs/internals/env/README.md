# Env Internals

This directory is scaffolding: it is intended to hold developer-facing env var documentation.

- Inventory (exhaustive): `docs/internals/env/inventory.md`
- Supported operator contract: `docs/reference/env/contract.md`

Suggested follow-on docs:
- How the inventory is generated/updated (if automated)
- Ownership rules (which component sets/reads each category)
