# Environment Variable Inventory Generation

This file is scaffolding: it should describe how `docs/internals/env/inventory.md` is maintained.

Suggested contents:
- Whether the inventory is hand-maintained or generated
- If generated: the script(s) and update workflow
- How to handle cross-platform-only variables and test fixtures
