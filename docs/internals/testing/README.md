# Testing Internals

This directory is scaffolding: it is intended to hold developer-facing notes for testing workflows and local debugging.

Suggested contents:
- how to run targeted test suites per crate
- cross-platform smoke workflows and runner assumptions
- test-only environment variables and fixtures
