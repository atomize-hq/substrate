# CLI Contract

This file is scaffolding: it will define the stable CLI contract for `substrate` and top-level subcommands.

Suggested sections:
- Command list (what exists)
- Flag semantics and precedence rules (especially for config/policy/world toggles)
- Exit codes and error class taxonomy (with examples)
- JSON output contract for `--json` endpoints (shape stability)
