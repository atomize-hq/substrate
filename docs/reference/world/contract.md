# World Contract

This file is scaffolding: it will define the stable, operator-facing contract for world isolation:
- enable/disable semantics (`--world`, `--no-world`, install defaults),
- socket/agent expectations for supported platforms,
- failure modes and exit codes,
- and how world_fs policy settings affect behavior.
