# Paths Reference

This directory is scaffolding: it is intended to define stable filesystem locations used by Substrate.

Suggested contents:
- `$SUBSTRATE_HOME` and defaults per platform
- Trace/log locations
- Workspace directory structure under `<workspace_root>/.substrate/`
- Any other paths intended to be stable for operators
