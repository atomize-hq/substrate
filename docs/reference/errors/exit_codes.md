# Exit Codes (Operator Contract)

This file is scaffolding: it will define Substrate’s stable exit code meanings for operators and automation.

Primary reference today:
- `docs/project_management/standards/EXIT_CODE_TAXONOMY.md`

This file should eventually:
- restate the canonical taxonomy in operator terms,
- call out any feature-specific overrides (rare; explicitly documented),
- and provide examples of common failure modes.
