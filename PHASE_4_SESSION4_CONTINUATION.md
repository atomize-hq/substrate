# Phase 4 Continuation - Session 4

## 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

Continue Phase 4 implementation of the Substrate project. Major progress has been made with PR#10 (overlayfs/networking) and PR#11 (LD_PRELOAD telemetry) now complete. Ready to proceed with PR#12 (HRM scaffolding).

**Current Working Directory**: `/Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/atomize-hq/substrate`

## 📋 Session 3 Accomplishments (2025-09-03)

### ✅ PR#11 Complete: LD_PRELOAD Telemetry Library
- **Telemetry library** (`crates/telemetry-lib/`): Full syscall interception for exec, file, and network operations
- **Session correlation**: Maintains substrate session/span IDs through fork/exec boundaries
- **Docker testing**: Successfully tested in Ubuntu containers (macOS DYLD limitations bypassed)
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive TELEMETRY.md guide
- **Integration ready**: Library prepared for injection when `SUBSTRATE_WORLD=enabled`

### 🎯 Key Technical Achievements
- Intercepted 10+ syscall types with <10ms overhead
- Implemented lazy initialization to avoid constructor issues
- Cross-platform build system (Linux .so in Docker, macOS .dylib native)
- Full trace.jsonl compatibility with existing span format

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Status

### What's Complete
- ✅ **PR#1-9**: Agent API, Broker, Trace, World backends (all compiling)
- ✅ **PR#10**: Overlayfs filesystem diff + nftables network filtering
- ✅ **PR#11**: LD_PRELOAD telemetry library with full syscall interception
- ✅ Shell + Shim + Broker + World + Telemetry integration ready
- ✅ Trace spans with policy decisions and telemetry events

### What Needs Implementation (Next PRs)
1. **PR#12**: HRM (Hot Reload Module) scaffolding - NEXT PRIORITY
2. **PR#13**: Kuzu graph database integration  
3. **PR#14**: Comprehensive test suites
4. **PR#15**: VM/Agent runtime testing

## 🎯 Next Priority: PR#12 - HRM Scaffolding

According to the master plan, implement the Hot Reload Module for trace replay capabilities.

### Implementation Goals for PR#12
1. **Create HRM module structure** (`crates/hrm/`):
   - Trace replay engine
   - State reconstruction from spans
   - Command re-execution framework
   - Deterministic replay guarantees

2. **Key components to build**:
   - Trace reader/parser for historical spans
   - State machine for replay sequencing
   - Environment reconstruction from replay_context
   - Output comparison for regression detection

3. **Integration points**:
   - Connect to existing trace.jsonl files
   - Use broker for policy evaluation during replay
   - Leverage world backends for isolated re-execution

### Quick Test Commands
```bash
# Verify current state (all should work)
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace

# Test telemetry in Docker
docker run --rm telemetry-test

# Test world+telemetry integration
SUBSTRATE_WORLD=enabled cargo run --bin substrate -- -c "ls"
tail -5 ~/.substrate/trace.jsonl | jq .

# View collected telemetry
cat ~/.substrate/trace.jsonl | jq 'select(.event_type == "syscall")' | head
```

## 💡 Implementation Notes for PR#12 (HRM)

### Suggested File Structure
```
crates/hrm/
├── Cargo.toml
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs          # Public API
│   ├── replay.rs       # Replay engine
│   ├── state.rs        # State reconstruction
│   ├── compare.rs      # Output comparison
│   └── regression.rs   # Regression detection
```

### Key Design Considerations
1. **Determinism**: Must handle non-deterministic elements (timestamps, PIDs, random values)
2. **Isolation**: Each replay in fresh world to avoid contamination
3. **Performance**: Efficient trace parsing and state tracking
4. **Debugging**: Clear reporting of replay divergence points

### Testing Approach
- Record traces of known command sequences
- Replay and verify identical outcomes
- Introduce controlled changes to test regression detection
- Benchmark replay performance vs original execution

## 🚦 Success Metrics for Session 4
- [ ] HRM module structure created and compiling
- [ ] Basic trace replay engine functional
- [ ] Can replay simple command from trace.jsonl
- [ ] State reconstruction from replay_context working
- [ ] Output comparison detecting differences
- [ ] Integration test with world backend
- [ ] Documentation for HRM module

## 📝 Context for AI Assistant

You are continuing Phase 4 of the Substrate project. The codebase is a command tracing ecosystem with:
- Custom shell that intercepts all commands
- Shim layer for binary interception
- Broker for policy evaluation
- World backends for isolation (Linux native, Docker, future Lima)
- Telemetry library for syscall-level tracking
- Trace system recording all execution spans

Recent work completed PR#10 (filesystem/network tracking) and PR#11 (LD_PRELOAD telemetry). The next goal is PR#12: implementing HRM for deterministic trace replay capabilities. This will enable regression testing and debugging by replaying recorded command sequences.

The architecture is greenfield - make clean design decisions without legacy concerns. Focus on Linux first, with macOS support via Docker/Lima VMs.

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

1. **Test in Docker on macOS**: LD_PRELOAD doesn't work with DYLD on macOS due to SIP
2. **Performance target**: Keep overhead <50ms per command, <10ms per syscall
3. **Security**: Telemetry observes only, never enforces
4. **Workspace builds**: Always test with `cargo build --workspace`
5. **Trace everything**: Every significant action should generate a span
