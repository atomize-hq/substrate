Below is a crisp review with concrete fixes and guardrails so your next execution step (‚Äúwindows_host_transport_plan.md‚Äù) lands cleanly and stays consistent with the earlier plans.

## TL;DR ‚Äî Does it all track?

**Mostly yes**, with a few material gaps to fix before you start executing the Windows addendum:

1. **Build artifact mismatch for the agent on Windows/WSL** ‚Äî the warm script copies a Windows `.exe` into WSL; that will fail with `Exec format error`. Build the Linux ELF inside WSL and install that binary. 
2. **WSL/systemd assumption** ‚Äî plans use `systemctl` inside WSL but never ensure `systemd=true` in `/etc/wsl.conf` and a full WSL shutdown/restart. Add this to provisioning or you‚Äôll see ‚ÄúSystem has not been booted with systemd‚Äù errors. 
3. **WebSocket transport on Windows** ‚Äî the current text mixes ‚Äúconnect directly to `ws://127.0.0.1:17788`‚Äù with named‚Äëpipe bridging. Decide on **one host endpoint** for the shell: **named pipe** to the forwarder, and let the forwarder proxy HTTP/WS to the agent. Don‚Äôt require the shell to speak TCP on Windows.
4. **Telemetry parity** ‚Äî Windows plan calls out `display_path` but not the **`transport.mode`** field the spike requires; add it so traces prove transport routing on all OSes. 
5. **Doc/knob parity drift** ‚Äî macOS plan intentionally **removed** operator transport overrides to preserve parity, while the spike/addendum reintroduce several knobs. Reconcile the story or clearly scope overrides to *internal tooling only*.
6. **WSL isolation semantics** ‚Äî netns/nftables/cgroups often behave differently under WSL2. The Windows plan assumes full parity; keep ‚Äúobserve‚Äëonly‚Äù fallback explicit and acceptance tests tolerant when kernel features are unavailable. 

Everything else‚Äîthe ‚Äúalways‚Äëin‚Äëworld‚Äù flow, `WorldSpec.always_isolate`, replay alignment, PTY path shape, and transport abstraction‚Äîis coherent across the docs.

## High‚Äëimpact fixes before you execute **windows_host_transport_plan.md**

### 1) Build & install the **Linux** agent inside WSL (not a Windows `.exe`)

**What to change**

* In `wsl-warm.ps1`, replace the host build + copy of `world-agent.exe` with a **WSL‚Äëinternal build** of the Linux binary, then install it in `/usr/local/bin/substrate-world-agent`. This also matches your mac plan note to build inside the guest to avoid arch drift. 

**Rationale**

* Current step copies `target\release\world-agent.exe` into WSL and tries to run it as `substrate-world-agent`; that‚Äôs a Windows PE, not an ELF. This will fail at service start. 

### 2) Enable `systemd` in WSL up front

**What to add to provisioning**

* Create `/etc/wsl.conf` with:

  ```ini
  [boot]
  systemd=true
  ```
* After provisioning, run on host:

  ```powershell
  wsl --shutdown
  wsl -d substrate-wsl
  ```
* Only then `systemctl enable --now substrate-world-agent`. This matches your plan‚Äôs reliance on systemd units. 

### 3) Make the **named pipe** the single Windows host endpoint

**What to do**

* Keep `substrate-forwarder` listening on **one named pipe** (e.g., `\\.\pipe\substrate-agent`) and **proxy both HTTP and WebSocket** (Upgrade) over byte streams to the agent‚Äôs UDS/TCP. Ensure the forwarder treats WS as just another HTTP request and streams bytes bidirectionally.
* Remove host‚Äëvisible TCP for the shell path. If you need a TCP target, keep it **inside WSL** (agent loopback) as already sketched; the forwarder connects *to* that. 

**Why**

* Your spike/design show: host ‚Üí `agent-api-client` ‚Üí **connector** ‚Üí forwarder (Windows only) ‚Üí agent (UDS/TCP). The shell shouldn‚Äôt need a second ‚ÄúWindows TCP‚Äù mode; it complicates parity and security.

**Code‚Äëlevel guardrail**

* In `agent-api-client`, ensure the **NamedPipe connector** supports both regular HTTP and WS handshake so PTY streams work without adding a host TCP listener. 

### 4) Add `transport.mode` to traces on **all** platforms

**What to do**

* Update trace schema to include:

  ```json
  "transport": { "mode": "named_pipe|unix|tcp", "endpoint": "<sanitized>" }
  ```
* The spike mandates this and the smoke suites expect it. Add tests that assert the field on Windows/mac/Linux. 

### 5) Reconcile transport override knobs with the mac plan‚Äôs parity stance

**What to do**

* Keep end‚Äëuser CLI/env overrides **off by default** (match mac/Linux simplicity), and constrain any overrides to **dev‚Äëonly** docs (doctor/smoke) or **internal** config (forwarder TOML). The mac plan explicitly warns about divergence. 
* If you **must** expose overrides, do it 1:1:1 across platforms (same names, same behavior) and document them in **one place**, linked from all plans. The spike‚Äôs forwarder overrides (`SUBSTRATE_FORWARDER_TARGET`) are acceptable if kept internal.

### 6) Bake WSL capability variance into acceptance

**What to add**

* Explicitly allow **observe‚Äëonly** mode when netns/nftables/cgroup features aren‚Äôt available or fail, but keep a single, clear WARN (same phrasing as Linux/mac). Your Windows doc states parity goals; just add a reality check in acceptance to prevent blocking on kernel limits. 

---

## File‚Äëby‚Äëfile notes (what looks great vs. what to tweak)

### Linux Phase 4.5 (baseline semantics)

* ‚úÖ ‚ÄúAlways ensure world,‚Äù non‚ÄëPTY via backend, `fs_diff` inline, and `WorldSpec.always_isolate` are clear and reusable. Good that replay routes through world‚Äëapi, not bespoke isolation. 
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Carry forward the **single WARN** degrade pattern and `fs_diff` immediate preference to Windows/mac plans (you mostly have). 

### macOS Phase 4.5 (Lima)

* ‚úÖ Architecture and phased approach are thorough; the ‚ÄúDoctor CLI Parity (macOS + Linux)‚Äù section is excellent‚Äî**mirror this on Windows** so `substrate world doctor` has a uniform JSON schema across OSes. 
* ‚ö†Ô∏è The doc both discourages transport/env overrides *and* lists them in Appendix F/backlog. Keep a single source of truth; I recommend the backlog stance (off by default, parity if ever added). 

### Windows Phase 5 (WSL ‚ÄúAlways World‚Äù)

* ‚úÖ End‚Äëto‚Äëend plan with forwarder + ConPTY + path translation + replay parity is the right shape. The Validation Matrix and smoke/CI sections are solid. 
* üîß **Fixes needed** (already summarized above):

  * Build the **Linux** agent *inside WSL*; don‚Äôt copy a Windows `.exe`. 
  * Ensure `systemd=true` in WSL before using `systemctl`. 
  * Clarify WS path: host talks **only** to the named pipe; forwarder bridges WS/HTTP to agent. Remove the ‚Äúconnect to 127.0.0.1:17788 from host‚Äù instruction unless the forwarder actually exposes a host TCP listener (your design doc doesn‚Äôt). 
  * Add `transport.mode` to traces (alignment with spike). 

### Transport Parity Spike

* ‚úÖ The connector abstraction + telemetry requirements are clear and necessary to remove `hyperlocal`/Unix‚Äëonly imports from host crates. Keep the connector as the **only** way host code reaches the agent. 
* üîß Be explicit that Windows host **always** uses the **NamedPipe** connector (no host TCP), and the forwarder targets **UDS or loopback TCP in WSL**. That matches your diagram intent. 

### Transport Architecture Sketch

* ‚úÖ Clear depiction of the forwarder‚Äôs role and the dual listener on the agent (UDS + loopback TCP). Telemetry (`transport.mode`) is called out‚Äîpropagate this into Windows acceptance. 

### **Most‚Äërecent** Windows Host Transport Addendum (what you‚Äôll execute next)

* ‚úÖ Good, actionable checklist to expose agent transport from `world-windows-wsl`, wire `platform_world::windows`, and verify forwarder + telemetry. 
* üîß Please add:

  * A step to **build the agent in WSL** (or cross‚Äëcompile for Linux), and update the warm script accordingly. 
  * A step to **assert `systemd=true`** in provisioning (doctor should check `systemctl is-active` only after confirming systemd is enabled). 
  * A test that **PTY over WS** works **over NamedPipe** (no host TCP), proving your connector + forwarder can upgrade HTTP and stream. 
  * A note that the addendum should not re‚Äëintroduce end‚Äëuser transport knobs unless done 1:1:1 across OSes (stick to forwarder‚Äëlocal config). 

---

## Windows‚Äëspecific gotchas to anticipate (and how to defuse them)

1. **ConPTY quirks**

   * Disable QuickEdit mode and ensure you propagate `CTRL_C_EVENT` ‚Üí agent `INT` in WS frames; test echo storms and window resize. Your plan covers signals/resizes‚Äîkeep a single codepath behind `cfg(target_os="windows")`. 

2. **Named Pipe ACLs**

   * Create the pipe with a DACL granting only the current user (and service account if any). Log the pipe SDDL at startup for diagnostics; your addendum mentions pipe sanitization‚Äîmake it explicit. 

3. **Path translation edge cases**

   * Include tests for `C:\`, UNC (`\\server\share\dir`), spaces, `..` segments, and case folding. The plan covers UNC and drive letters; add dot‚Äësegment normalization and round‚Äëtrip tests. 

4. **WSL kernel feature variance**

   * When netns/nftables fail, emit exactly one WARN and proceed in observe‚Äëonly. Add doctor checks that report kernel and nft availability without failing the whole suite. 

---

## Minimal diffs you can apply immediately (templates)

* **Provision WSL with systemd and agent install**

  ```bash
  # inside scripts/wsl/provision.sh
  cat >/etc/wsl.conf <<'EOF'
  [boot]
  systemd=true
  EOF

  systemctl daemon-reload
  systemctl enable substrate-world-agent.service
  ```

  And in the warm script, after copying the repo:

  ```powershell
  # Build Linux agent *inside* WSL, then install
  & wsl -d $DistroName -- bash -lc "set -euo pipefail; cd /mnt/c/$agentUnixPath; cargo build -p world-agent --release"
  & wsl -d $DistroName -- bash -lc "sudo install -m755 /mnt/c/$agentUnixPath/target/release/world-agent /usr/local/bin/substrate-world-agent"
  & wsl -d $DistroName -- bash -lc "sudo systemctl restart substrate-world-agent"
  ```

  (Replace the current `.exe` copy step.) 

* **Trace transport mode across OSes**

  ```rust
  // when finishing a span
  span.transport = Some(TransportMeta {
      mode: agent_client.transport_mode().as_str(), // "named_pipe" | "unix" | "tcp"
      endpoint: agent_client.transport_endpoint().redacted(),
  });
  ```

  Keep the schema consistent with the spike. 

* **Agent‚ÄëAPI client: NamedPipe WS support**

  * Ensure your NamedPipe connector implements `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Unpin` so `tokio_tungstenite::client_async` can drive the WS handshake over the pipe. Add an integration test that speaks to the forwarder and reaches the agent `/v1/stream`. 

---

## Acceptance criteria additions (Windows)

Add these to your Phase 5 validations:

* **Doctor parity**: `substrate world doctor --json` on Windows returns `{"platform":"windows","ok":true,...}` using the **same JSON keys** as mac/Linux doctor (add Windows checks you already scripted). 
* **Transport proof**: last 3 trace entries show `"transport.mode":"named_pipe"` on Windows, `"unix"` on mac/Linux. The smoke scripts should assert this. 
* **WS PTY over pipe**: `substrate --pty -c 'printf hi\n'` works through the named‚Äëpipe ‚Üí forwarder ‚Üí agent WS path (no host TCP). 

---

## Final verdict

The architecture is sound and the cross‚Äëplatform story is achievable. If you fix the **agent build target**, **WSL/systemd** enabling, **WS strategy over the pipe**, and **telemetry parity**, your Windows execution next step should proceed smoothly and remain aligned with the Linux/mac plans and the spike/design docs.

If you‚Äôd like, I can turn the items above into concrete PR‚Äëready diffs for the warm script, provisioning script, and a short checklist patch to your Windows addendum.
